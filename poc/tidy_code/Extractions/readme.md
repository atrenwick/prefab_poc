About the Extractions folder and its scripts
This folder contains the scripts used to process results from the Lexicoscope.

The script send_concordances... tidies and prepares concordances for a folder of concordance tables.

The scripts named step_ form part of a larger script which processes bulk results.
There are three steps : converting raw to df, converting df to excel, and consolidating excels to final document.
Where there are oral specific scripts, they deal with the fact oral requetes have three types, with results for each corpus.
Where there are roman specific scripts, they deal with the fact roman requetes have 2 arms, as well as results for each corpus.
Where there are wiki specific scripts, they deal with the simpler cases of 2 arms to a requete.
